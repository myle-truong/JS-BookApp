- Repository: `AJAX-PROJECT_NAME`
- Type of Challenge: `Consolidation Challenge`
- Duration: `5 days`
- Deployment strategy : `GitHub pages`
- Team challenge : `No`

## The Mission
This week you will create your own project from concept to finish in small groups! 

I cannot wait to see what you all will create!*

### Pitch perfect
You will look for a free API to integrate with and think of a fun implementation with this. 

You can find a large collection free API's to use:  

- https://www.programmableweb.com/category/all/apis. 
- https://rapidapi.com/  
- https://github.com/public-apis/public-apis 

You can combine several API's in your application if you want to provide more value for your users.

You do not need to have a realistic monetisation model, or take into account the problems of working with Intellectual Property. It would for example be ok√© to make some game with the Open Star Wars API, without having the licenses for it.
You are also allowed to "hand wave" an integration with a payment integrator, you can just provide a "purchase" button that when clicked adds some virtual currency (for a game), allows access to a pay wall area, ...

## Must-have features

- [ ] No dead links
- [ ] No "lorum ipsum" texts
